    <p>I am a student studying master’s at Birmingham City University. Currently I work as care assistant where I have had the privilege to look after many vulnerable adults. This role has helped me to take on various responsibilities and become a dependable individual. Genuine care and respect for a client’s needs are always my priority; it provides me great satisfaction to see that the work I do creates a difference in a client’s quality of life. As a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a passion for providing excellent service, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to support the catering needs of the hospital's patients, visitors, and staff.
